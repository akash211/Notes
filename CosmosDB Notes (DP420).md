**JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is an open standard file format, and data interchange format, that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value).
      JSON is a language-independent data format with well-defined data types and near universal support across a diverse range of services and programing languages.
      Below is an example of JSON document.
      ```JSON
              {
          "id": "0012D555-C7DE",
          "type": "customer",
          "fullName": "Franklin Ye",
          "title": null,
          "emailAddress": "fye@cosmic.works",
          "creationDate": "2014-02-05",
          "addresses": [
            {
              "addressLine": "1796 Westbury Drive",
              "cityStateZip": "Melton, VIC 3337 AU"
            },
            {
              "addressLine": "9505 Hargate Court",
              "cityStateZip": "Bellflower, CA 90706 US"
            }
          ],
          "password": {
            "hash": "GQF7qjEgMk=",
            "salt": "12C0F5A5"
          },
          "salesOrderCount": 2
        }
      ```

An Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account is composed of a basic hierarchy of resources that include:
    a. **An account** : - Each tenant of the Azure Cosmos DB service is created by provisioning a database account. 
                    - Accounts are the fundamental units of distribution and high availability. 
                    - At the account level, you can configure the region[s] for your data in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. 
                    - Accounts also contain the globally unique DNS name used for API requests
    b. **One or more databases** : - A database is a logical unit of management for containers in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. 
                               - An Azure Cosmos DB database manages users, permissions, and containers. 
                               - Within the database, you can find one or more containers. 
                               - You can also elect to provision throughput for your data here at the database level.
    c. **One or more containers** : - Containers are the fundamental unit of scalability in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. 
                                - Typically, you provision throughput at the container level. 
                                - Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL will automatically and transparently partition the data in a container. 
                                - You can also optionally configure an indexing policy or a default time-to-live value at the container level.
                                - Containers can also store JavaScript based stored procedures, triggers and user-defined-functions (UDFs).
    d. **Many items** : - An Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL resource container is a schema-agnostic container of arbitrary user-generated JSON items. 
                    - The NoSQL API for Azure Cosmos DB stores individual documents in JSON format as items within the container. 
                    - Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL natively supports JSON files and can provide fast and predictable performance because write operations on JSON documents are atomic
When creating a new account in the Azure portal, you must first select an API for your workload. The API selection cannot be changed after the account is created. 
Below is the list of APIs available:
  a. Azure CosmosDB for NoSQL
  b. Azure CosmosDB for MongoDB
  c. Azure CosmosDB for Apache Cassandra
  d. Azure CosmosDB for Table
  e. Azure CosmosDB for Apache Gremlin
  f. Azure CosmosDB for PostGreSQL
